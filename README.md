# ejs-prebuilt

[EJS](https://ejs.coo/) is written for node.js, and the developers do not support running it in the browser as an ES6 module, but only as an UMD file (polluting the global scope) using Browserify.

[ejs4b](https://github.com/mobily-enterprises/ejs4b) is a package that prepares ESLint for browser use as an ES6 module.
